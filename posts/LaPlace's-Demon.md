### 😈 Is our future predestined? Laplace's Demon 😈 

Have you wondered if **the future is already written?** The idea of ​​"*Laplace's Demon*" suggests that if an entity could know the position and speed of all the particles in the universe and the laws of physics that govern them, it could predict the future and describe the past accurately. This is based on the idea that the current state of events is the consequence of their previous state and, in turn, is the cause of the one that follows. 🌌🔮

 But is this really possible? Quantum mechanics and chaos theory tell us quite the opposite. In the quantum world, things work more based on probabilities than certainties. And chaos theory teaches us that small changes can have big and unpredictable effects (like the famous "butterfly effect"). 🦋🌪️ So do we have free will? Modern science suggests that the universe is so complex that, although certain things can be determined, predicting the exact future is virtually impossible. This leaves us room for freedom and choice (or not). 🤔✨
