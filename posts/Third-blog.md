In this entry, I will talk about the concept of **_romanticizing life_**. Lately, my social media has been filled with videos about the lives of unknown people. Colorful photos with music where people appeared very happy.

With the first video I saw, I thought, _"Wow, that's cool"_. But after watching a few more, I told myself that not all lives are the same, and I couldn't make those kinds of videos since my life wasn't even half as beautiful.

Fortunately, I remembered that on _social media_, nobody is what they claim to be. I made my versions of the videosâ€”30-second clips summarizing the day, photos with friends, and landscapes I liked. Gradually, I realized that my shorts, far from being as perfect and animated, were in a way romantic.

If you look up the meaning of the word _"romanticize"_, it will appear as a synonym for idealize. 
> `It's about finding happiness in the simple things of everyday life.` 

For this reason, when I focused on recording each special moment, I enjoyed it to the fullest.

# How to romanticize your life.

On the internet, there are millions of different videos of people giving advice on how to do it. They suggest things like having a glass of wine a day or bathing in rose petals. But the truth is, I don't think these are the best recommendations because they are very superficial, and from the beginning, all lives are ideal. After all, you are the protagonist of your own story, and all you have to do is learn to recognize the small unique moments you live, and to do that, it ***would be good to***:

1. **Appreciate what you have.**


Although it may seem very simple, often we want more than we have, and that makes us stop appreciating what we already have.

2. **Live in the moment.**

Don't think about what you have to do tomorrow or what you did wrong yesterday. The important thing is what is happening right now.

3. **Disconnect from technology.**

I know it's difficult; sometimes, I don't do it either. But when you are with family or friends, don't turn on your phone. Be 100% with them.

4. **Go into nature.**

Currently, people spend almost the entire day indoors. But you have to try to find time every day to do activities outside the house. Go outdoors, walk by the sea, climb a mountain...

5. **Do things you like.**

Fill your time with hobbies you enjoy. Move for what you like, not for what others do, because that way you can enjoy each moment even more.

***On the other hand***, remember that the last thing you should do is idealize a difficult situation because by doing so, some conflicts that are not okay are normalized, and society needs to realize and change them. For example, some psychological problems, serious illnesses, a toxic relationship, or other problematic situations.

#### In conclusion, 
> You don't need to make videos or constantly post to romanticize your life. 
>
> Just live each moment to the fullest and make the simplest moments the most perfect ones.
